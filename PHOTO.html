  <pre> Words are winds that evade me from time to time, but art never fails me when I need to share my thoughts. 
  For as long as I can remember, I've been drawn to all types of art in life. 
  From visual to performing, from casually improvised works to meticulously planned and executed photographs, 
  I found ways to best communicate my ideas and express myself through art.
